# MBT-Instances
Describe instances of Minimum Broadcast Time

The instances are three kind of:

- Harary graph: Is a particular example of a k-connected graph with graph vertices having the smallest possible number of edges.
- Small world graph: Is a type of mathematical graph in which most nodes are not neighbors of one another, but the neighbors of any given node are likely to be neighbors of each other and most nodes can be reached from every other node by a small number of hops or steps.
- Synthetic graph: Is a synthetic graph based on a binomial tree added with a random graph. The MBT value is the order of the tree.
